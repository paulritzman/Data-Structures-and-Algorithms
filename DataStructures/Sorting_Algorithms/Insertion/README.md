# Insertion Sort

An application demonstrating the implementation of an insertion sorting algorithm on an integer array.

## Challenge

Within your Program.cs file, create a method named InsertionSort() that takes in an unsorted array and returns a sorted array.

Inside your Main():
* output the unsorted array.
* Send the array through your InsertionSort()
* Output the sorted array

Insertion sorting algorithms sort from front to rear of an array, building the final solution one
element at a time. The worst-case efficiency for an insertion sort is O(n<sup>2</sup>).
