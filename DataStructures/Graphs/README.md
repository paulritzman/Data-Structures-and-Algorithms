* GetNodes() - Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection
* GetNeighbors() - Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
* Size() - Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
* BreadthFirst() - Takes in a root node, and returns a collection of all the nodes visited in order
